# Abstract
Understanding which traffic light controls which lane is crucial to navigate intersections safely.
Autonomous vehicles commonly rely on High Definition (HD) maps that contain information about the assignment of traffic lights to lanes.
The manual provisioning of this information is tedious, expensive, and not scalable.
To remedy these issues, our novel approach derives the assignments from traffic light states and the corresponding motion patterns of vehicle traffic.
This works in an automated way and independently of the geometric arrangement.
We show the effectiveness of basic statistical approaches for this task by implementing and evaluating a pattern-based contribution method.
In addition, our novel rejection method includes accompanying safety considerations by leveraging statistical hypothesis testing.
Finally, we propose a dataset transformation to re-purpose available motion prediction datasets for semantic map learning.
Our publicly available API for the Lyft Level 5 dataset enables researchers to develop and evaluate their own approaches.
